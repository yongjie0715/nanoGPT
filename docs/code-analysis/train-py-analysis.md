## File Overview

The `train.py` file is the main training script for the nanoGPT project. It serves as the central orchestrator for training GPT models from scratch, resuming from checkpoints, or fine-tuning from pre-trained OpenAI GPT-2 weights. This script supports both single-GPU training for development and distributed data parallel (DDP) training for production-scale model training across multiple GPUs and nodes.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Configuration management and parameter validation → *See [Configuration System](configurator-py-analysis.md)*
- Distributed training setup and coordination → *See [Distributed Training Concepts](../concepts/training-process.md#distributed-training)*
- Model initialization and checkpoint management → *Uses [GPT Model](model-py-analysis.md#gpt-model-class-structure)*
- Training loop execution with gradient accumulation → *See [Training Process Theory](../concepts/training-process.md#gradient-descent-and-optimization)*
- Learning rate scheduling and optimization → *See [Optimization Concepts](../concepts/training-process.md#optimization-algorithms)*
- Loss evaluation and performance monitoring → *See [Language Modeling Objective](../concepts/training-process.md#next-token-prediction)*
- Checkpoint saving and restoration → *Used by [Inference Pipeline](sample-py-analysis.md#model-loading)*

**Execution Modes:**
- Single GPU debug mode: `python train.py --batch_size=32 --compile=False`
- Multi-GPU DDP mode: `torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 train.py`
- Multi-node DDP mode: Coordinated across multiple machines with torchrun

exec(open('configurator.py').read()) # overrides from command line or config file
config = {k: globals()[k] for k in config_keys} # will be useful for logging
```

**System Explanation:**
