# Product Vision - nanoGPT

## Purpose
nanoGPT is an educational and research-focused implementation of GPT language models that prioritizes simplicity, readability, and hackability over complex abstractions. It serves as a minimal, clean foundation for understanding and experimenting with transformer-based language models.

## Target Users
- **Students and researchers** learning about transformer architecture and language modeling
- **ML practitioners** who need a clean, understandable codebase for experimentation
- **Educators** teaching deep learning and natural language processing concepts
- **Researchers** conducting experiments on language model training and architecture

## Core Value Propositions
1. **Simplicity**: Core functionality in ~600 lines of code (train.py + model.py)
2. **Educational clarity**: Code is written to be readable and understandable
3. **Hackability**: Easy to modify and extend for custom experiments
4. **Performance**: Capable of reproducing GPT-2 results while remaining simple
5. **Accessibility**: Works on various hardware from laptops to multi-GPU clusters

## Key Features
- **Training**: From-scratch training of GPT models on custom datasets
- **Finetuning**: Adapt pretrained models to new domains/tasks
- **Sampling/Inference**: Generate text from trained models
- **Multiple scales**: Support for models from tiny (6-layer) to GPT-2 XL (1.5B params)
- **Distributed training**: Multi-GPU and multi-node training support
- **Flexible tokenization**: Character-level and BPE tokenization
- **Monitoring**: Integration with Weights & Biases for experiment tracking

## Success Metrics
- **Reproducibility**: Ability to match published GPT-2 benchmarks
- **Training efficiency**: Reasonable training times on standard hardware
- **Code clarity**: Maintainability and educational value of the codebase
- **Community adoption**: Usage in educational settings and research projects

## Business Objectives
- Serve as a reference implementation for GPT architecture
- Enable educational use in academic courses and tutorials
