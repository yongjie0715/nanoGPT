# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The dashboard feature will provide enhanced real-time visualization capabilities for nanoGPT training processes, building upon the existing basic dashboard infrastructure. This feature aims to deliver comprehensive training insights through interactive visualizations, real-time metric monitoring, and advanced analytical tools that help researchers and ML engineers understand model training dynamics.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This dashboard enhancement supports the core nanoGPT mission of providing educational and research-focused ML tools by:
- Making training processes more transparent and understandable
- Enabling better research insights through advanced visualization
- Providing real-time feedback for training optimization
- Supporting educational use cases with clear visual representation of concepts

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Real-time Training Visualization

**User Story:** As a machine learning researcher, I want to see comprehensive real-time training metrics with interactive visualizations, so that I can understand training dynamics and make informed decisions about hyperparameter adjustments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training starts THEN the dashboard SHALL display real-time loss curves with smooth animation
2. WHEN new training metrics arrive THEN the system SHALL update visualizations within 500ms
3. WHEN I hover over data points THEN the system SHALL display detailed metric information including timestamp, iteration, and exact values
4. WHEN training runs for extended periods THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance with efficient data management
5. IF the connection is lost THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect and resume displaying metrics
6. WHEN displaying more than 10,000 data points THEN the system SHALL implement data sampling or aggregation
7. IF training data becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL display error indicators and attempt recovery
8. WHEN browser memory usage exceeds 512MB THEN the system SHALL purge oldest data points automatically

### Requirement 2: Interactive Model Architecture Visualization

**User Story:** As a researcher studying transformer architectures, I want to visualize the model structure and layer activations in real-time, so that I can understand how the model processes information during training.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN it SHALL display an interactive representation of the GPT model architecture
2. WHEN I click on model layers THEN the system SHALL show detailed layer information including parameters and dimensions
3. WHEN training is active THEN the system SHALL optionally display activation patterns and gradient flows
4. WHEN I select different model configurations THEN the visualization SHALL update to reflect the architecture changes
5. IF model information is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a placeholder with clear messaging
6. WHEN visualizing large models THEN the system SHALL provide zoom and pan capabilities for navigation

### Requirement 3: Advanced Training Analytics

**User Story:** As an ML engineer optimizing training processes, I want access to advanced analytics and trend analysis, so that I can identify training issues early and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training data accumulates THEN the system SHALL calculate and display training velocity, convergence indicators, and performance trends
2. WHEN training anomalies occur THEN the system SHALL highlight potential issues with visual indicators
3. WHEN I request detailed analysis THEN the system SHALL provide statistical summaries and training efficiency metrics
4. WHEN comparing different training runs THEN the system SHALL support side-by-side metric comparisons

### Requirement 4: Responsive Multi-Device Interface

**User Story:** As a researcher working across different devices, I want the dashboard to work seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, so that I can monitor training progress from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessed on any device THEN the dashboard SHALL automatically adapt to screen size and input method
2. WHEN using touch interfaces THEN all interactive elements SHALL be appropriately sized and responsive
3. WHEN the viewport changes THEN visualizations SHALL resize and reflow without losing data
4. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL prioritize essential information and provide condensed views

### Requirement 5: Data Export and Sharing Capabilities

**User Story:** As a researcher collaborating with colleagues, I want to export training data and share dashboard views, so that I can include results in papers and collaborate effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request data export THEN the system SHALL provide training metrics in standard formats (CSV, JSON)
2. WHEN I want to share results THEN the system SHALL generate shareable links with snapshot views
3. WHEN exporting visualizations THEN the system SHALL support high-quality image formats (PNG, SVG)
4. WHEN saving training runs THEN the system SHALL preserve complete session data for later analysis
5. IF export operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 6: Training Process Integration

**User Story:** As a user running nanoGPT training, I want the dashboard to automatically connect to my training session without manual configuration, so that I can focus on training rather than setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start training with train.py THEN the dashboard SHALL automatically initialize and connect
2. WHEN training parameters change THEN the dashboard SHALL update its configuration automatically
3. WHEN multiple training sessions run THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between different sessions
4. IF the training process terminates THEN the dashboard SHALL maintain access to completed session data
5. WHEN training restarts from checkpoint THEN the dashboard SHALL seamlessly continue from the previous state
6. IF dashboard initialization fails THEN training SHALL continue without interruption
