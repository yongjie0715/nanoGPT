# Implementation Plan

## Task Overview
This plan breaks down the dashboard enhancement into atomic, agent-friendly tasks that extend the existing nanoGPT dashboard infrastructure. Each task is scoped to 15-30 minutes and focuses on single-purpose modifications to 1-3 files maximum.

## Atomic Task Requirements
**Each task meets these criteria for optimal agent execution:**
- **File Scope**: Touches 1-3 related files maximum
- **Time Boxing**: Completable in 15-30 minutes
- **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task
- **Specific Files**: Must specify exact files to create/modify
- **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching
