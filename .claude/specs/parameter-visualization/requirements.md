# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The parameter visualization feature will extend the existing nanoGPT dashboard with real-time 3D visualization of model parameters during training. This feature aims to provide educational insights into how neural network weights evolve, making the learning process transparent and helping researchers understand training dynamics at the parameter level. The implementation will follow MVP and KISS principles, building upon the existing dashboard infrastructure.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This parameter visualization enhancement supports the core nanoGPT mission of providing educational and research-focused ML tools by:
- Making parameter evolution visible and understandable during training
- Providing educational value through bbycroft-style 3D visualizations
- Enabling research insights into parameter dynamics and convergence patterns
- Supporting debugging and optimization through visual parameter inspection
- Maintaining the educational focus with clear, interpretable visualizations

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-time Parameter Extraction and Transmission

**User Story:** As a machine learning researcher, I want to see how model parameters change during training in real-time, so that I can understand the learning dynamics and identify potential training issues.

4. WHEN training runs for extended periods THEN the system SHALL maintain stable parameter extraction without affecting training performance
5. IF parameter extraction fails THEN training SHALL continue uninterrupted with clear error logging
6. WHEN parameter data exceeds memory limits THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent sampling and compression
7. WHEN multiple training sessions run THEN the system SHALL distinguish parameter streams by session ID

### Requirement 2: 3D Parameter Visualization Engine

**User Story:** As a researcher studying neural network training, I want to see parameters visualized in 3D space with smooth animations, so that I can observe patterns and changes that are not visible in traditional loss curves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN it SHALL initialize a 3D visualization engine using Three.js
2. WHEN parameter data arrives THEN the system SHALL render token embeddings as interactive 3D point clouds
3. WHEN I interact with the visualization THEN the system SHALL provide smooth camera controls (orbit, zoom, pan)
4. WHEN parameters update THEN the system SHALL animate transitions smoothly without performance degradation
5. IF 3D rendering fails THEN the system SHALL fallback gracefully to 2D parameter displays
6. WHEN visualizing large parameter sets THEN the system SHALL implement level-of-detail optimization
7. WHEN browser performance is limited THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce visualization complexity

### Requirement 3: Interactive Parameter Exploration

**User Story:** As an ML engineer debugging training issues, I want to filter and explore specific parameter types and layers, so that I can focus on areas of interest and identify problematic patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select parameter types THEN the system SHALL show/hide embeddings, attention weights, and MLP parameters
2. WHEN I choose specific layers THEN the system SHALL filter visualization to selected transformer layers
3. WHEN I hover over parameter points THEN the system SHALL display detailed information including values and gradients
4. WHEN I adjust visualization settings THEN the system SHALL update the display in real-time
5. IF no parameters match filters THEN the system SHALL display clear messaging and suggest alternatives
6. WHEN exploring parameters THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive interaction even with large datasets

### Requirement 4: Parameter Evolution Animation and Playback

**User Story:** As a researcher analyzing training dynamics, I want to replay parameter evolution over time, so that I can study how different phases of training affect parameter changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parameter history accumulates THEN the system SHALL store snapshots for playback
2. WHEN I request evolution playback THEN the system SHALL animate parameter changes over time
3. WHEN controlling playback THEN the system SHALL provide play/pause/speed controls
4. WHEN jumping to specific iterations THEN the system SHALL update visualization to that training state
5. IF memory limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent history pruning
6. WHEN exporting evolution data THEN the system SHALL provide parameter snapshots in standard formats

### Requirement 5: Educational Parameter Insights

**User Story:** As an educator teaching neural networks, I want the visualization to highlight important parameter behaviors and provide explanations, so that students can understand what they're observing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying parameters THEN the system SHALL provide contextual explanations for different parameter types
2. WHEN parameter patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL highlight interesting behaviors (convergence, divergence, clustering)
3. WHEN I request guided tours THEN the system SHALL provide educational walkthroughs of parameter evolution
4. WHEN training phases change THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and annotate different learning phases
5. IF unusual parameter behavior occurs THEN the system SHALL provide educational insights about potential causes
6. WHEN sharing visualizations THEN the system SHALL include educational annotations and explanations

### Requirement 6: Dashboard Integration and Performance

**User Story:** As a user of the existing nanoGPT dashboard, I want parameter visualization to integrate seamlessly without disrupting current functionality, so that I can use both loss monitoring and parameter visualization together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN parameter visualization SHALL be available as an additional tab/panel
2. WHEN switching between views THEN the system SHALL maintain both loss charts and parameter visualizations
3. WHEN parameter visualization is active THEN existing dashboard features SHALL remain fully functional
4. WHEN system resources are limited THEN parameter visualization SHALL automatically reduce quality to maintain performance
5. IF parameter visualization encounters errors THEN the main dashboard SHALL continue operating normally
6. WHEN training completes THEN both loss data and parameter evolution SHALL be preserved for analysis
